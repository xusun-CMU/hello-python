# Modules in Python are simply Python files with the .py extension, 
# which implement a set of functions. 
# Modules are imported from other modules using the import command.

# Exploring built-in modules
# Two very important functions come in handy when exploring modules in Python - the dir and help functions.
# We can look for which functions are implemented in each module by using the dir function:
# When we find the function in the module we want to use, 
# we can read about it more using the help function, inside the Python interpreter:

#e.g. dir(urllib)
#e.g. help(urllib.urlopen)
